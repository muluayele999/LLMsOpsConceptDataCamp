# LLM Ops Concepts Course Outline

## Course Description

LLMOps encompasses the practices, techniques, and tools used to deploy and manage large language models (LLMs) in production. Although LLMOps borrows heavily from MLOps, LLMs come with their own considerations and challenges. In this short, conceptual course, learners will discover the importance of LLMOps in extracting business value and impact from LLMs. Theyâ€™ll become familiar with the lifecycle of an LLM, and the different approaches that can be taken to develop and deploy these models in production. Learners will also become familiar with some of the challenges of monitoring these systems in production, and discuss techniques to mitigate them. This course should be tool-agnostic, given the relative immaturity of the LLMOps stack, and instead be focused on guiding principles that can help learners understand the process of productionizing and maintaining LLMs in production.

## Chapter 1: Foundations of LLMOps

### Lesson 1.1: Introduction to Large Language Models
- Learner will be able to define and identify the characteristics of large language models.

- Learner will be able to describe the LLMOps framework and its significance in the AI ecosystem.

### Lesson 1.3: Challenges in LLM Deployment
- Learner will be able to list and examine the primary challenges faced when deploying LLMs in production environments.

## Chapter 2: Developing LLMs

### Lesson 2.1: From Model to Production
- Learner will be able to outline the steps involved in taking LLMs from development to production.

### Lesson 2.2: Tool Selection for LLMOps
